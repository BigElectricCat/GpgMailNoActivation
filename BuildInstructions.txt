This was built with Xcode 10.0. Command line build tools must be installed.

1) First build Libmacgpg Framework
Change directory to Libmacgpg folder and run
make

2) Copy Libmacgpg.framework (from Libmacgpg/build/Release) to framework directories of each source dir:
 GPGMail_13/Frameworks
 GPGMail_14/Frameworks

3) Build each version of GPGMail
Change directory to GPGMail_13 and run 
make
Rename GPGMail_13/build/Release/GPGMail.mailbundle to GPGMail_14.mailbundle

Repeat for GPGMail_14

Note there does not appear to be any activation code in GPGMail_12 so there 
Is no need to build a new version.

When the normal GPGTools installer is run it places GPGMail_13.mailbundle and
GPGMail_14.mailbundle in directory:
/Library/Application\ Support/GPGTools/GPGMail/
Replace the mailbundles with the above built versions.
